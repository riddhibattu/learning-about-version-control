Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

## My Opinions on Version Control
I really like how version control allows for easy collaboration with team members where you can create branches work independently and then eventually collaborate and combine your progress togther. It is a great way to track and save your progress/changes. However, I find resolving merge conflicts to be a little challenging and sometimes confusing.
